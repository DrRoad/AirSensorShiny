<h2> About AirSensor DataViewer </h2>
<p>
  The AirShiny App as well as the AirSensor R-Package were developed through a
    collaboration between the South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD), a regional U.S.
    Governmental Agency in California, USA and Mazama Science, a software company in Seattle, WA. This tool is
    intended to support data exploration and analysis by community members participating in the US EPA funded
    STAR Grant at the South Coast AQMD, entitled “Engage, Educate and Empower California Communities on the Use
    and Applications of Low-cost Air Monitoring Sensors”. Funding for the development of this tool was provided
    through this US EPA STAR Grant (RD83618401).

<h3> QA Procedures </h3>
<p>
    Description of QA/QC Procedures: All data provided throughout this application
    (with the exception of the data displayed on the “Raw Data” tab on the Explorer page and the data shown on the “Latest Data” page) has
    undergone the following QA/QC procedures: (1) removal of values outside of the specifications for the sensors, as
    defined by the manufacturer, (2) pollutant values for Channel A and Channel B are averaged on an hourly basis,
    (3) if the proportion of points contributing to the hourly average meets the minimum requirement and the hourly
    averages are judged to be not statistically different, according to a student’s t-test, then the hourly averages for
    Channel A and B are averaged together – producing a single value for each hour. More detail on the procedures
    and functions used is available in the AirSensor R-Package documentation.
