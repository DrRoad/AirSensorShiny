  Once you select a sensor, the map will display the location of the nearest regulatory
  monitoring station (or AirNow site), and the plots will provide a comparison of the data
  from that sensor and the nearest regulatory monitoring site. The time series provides a
  qualitative comparison of the hourly-averaged data, while the scatter plot provides some
  additional statistics to better assess this comparison. In terms of the data displayed in the
  scatter plot â€“ on the horizontal axis (or x-axis) the data from the low-cost air quality sensor
  is plotted, while on the vertical axis (or y-axis) the data from the regulatory monitoring
  station (or AirNow site) is plotted.

  In terms of the statistics shared in the scatterplot, a slope close to 1.0 indicates that the
  low-cost sensor and the reference reflect similar levels. A slope greater than 1.0 indicates
  higher values are seen at the regulatory monitoring site and vice versa for a slope of less
  than 1.0. The intercept can be an indicator of bias, particularly if the slope is close to 1.0,
  but the intercept is either greater or less than zero. Finally, R2 provides an indication of how
  well the trends agree between the two sites; an R2 closer to 1.0 indicates more agreement
  and an R2 closer to 0.0 indicates less agreement.
