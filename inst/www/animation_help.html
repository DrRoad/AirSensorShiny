  On this page you can view animations of hourly average PM2.5 mass
  concentrations changing over time. Choose your community and a time
  frame and press ‘play’. Using the same color scale as other visualization
  in the app, purple corresponds to higher levels of PM2.5 and light blue
  to lower levels. The shading of the time slider indicates day vs. night,
  with white indicating daytime hours and grey indicating nighttime
  hours.
